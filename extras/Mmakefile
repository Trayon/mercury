# This Mmakefile provides some targets for building and installing most
# of the libraries in this `extras' distribution.
#
# Note that not all subdirectories of `extras' are set up for
# automatic installation.  This Mmakefile will only build those which are.
# In addition, libraries which are not reasonably portable won't get built.
# The following subdirectories are not included in the list that gets
# built by this Mmakefile, because they are often won't install
# "out-of-the-box":
#
#	graphics 	you need to have tcl/tk or OpenGL installed
#	morphine 	see morphine/README for instructions on how to install
#	concurrency 	doesn't work in all compilation grades
#	trailed_update 	doesn't work in all compilation grades
#	logged_output 	requires a specially-configured Mercury installation
#	odbc 		requires an ODBC driver be installed
#	quickcheck 	no `install' target
#	stream 		no `install' target; also has some modules shared with
#			the `concurrency' package.
