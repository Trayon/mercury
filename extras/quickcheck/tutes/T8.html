<h3> Generators - Random Functions</h3>
<pre>

Currently Quickcheck only has default generators for random functions that 
have 0 to 10 inputs, 1 output, and is in forward mode. This generated function 
can run on any type of inputs, but the output must be a type for which there is 
a custom/default generator.
The output may be indepedent of zero or more of the input arguments.
By this we mean that the value of an input argument may have no bearing upon the 
calculation of the output. There is a 5% chance per argument of this occurring. 

An example (use81.m)

prop1/1 just shows that given the same input, the output of the
sample function is the same.

prop3/1 shows that given different input, the random function will 
usually give different output (940/1000 cases). For the rest 60/1000 
cases, either the output is independent of input (most likely). Or 
it just so happens the output is the same for FFF(0) and FFF(1).
(Noet 60/1000 is roughly 5%)

prop2/1 shows 256/1000 cases shows that the random function returned the 
same output for different inputs. The real differenct between prop3/1 and
prop2/1 is that the output of prop2/1 is list(int), which means the chance
of generating [] is high (50% chance), and that's where 256/1000 cases come 
from.

prop4/1 's random function takes two inputs, the chance of both inputs being
independent of output is less compare to a random function which only takes
1 input. eg FFF(in)     = out, out independent of in is 5% chance
	    FFF(in, in) = out, out independent of in is 5% * 5% chance
