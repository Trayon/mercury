This directory contains stuff for doing coroutining with deterministic goals.
See the example programs:
	philo, philo2, philo3
		- several variants on the dining philosophers example.
		  philo uses a single semaphone for synchronization,
		  philo2 uses a single mvar,
		  while philo3 uses one semaphore per fork.
	midimon	- a midi data monitor that concurrently reads the bytestream,
		  parses the MIDI messages, and writes out the results.
		  A file `midi_data' has been included which contains some midi
		  data you can test the program with. MIDI (Musical Instrument
		  Digital Interface) is a hardware and software protocol for
		  electronic musical instruments (e.g. synthesizers) to talk to
		  each other.
