INTRODUCTION

Mercury is in the process of being ported to use the Microsoft Visual
C++ 6
compiler.  However not all dependencies on Cygwin have been removed and
cygwin is still required for installation (see README.MS-Windows).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFIGURATION

To use MSVC to build the compiler issue the following configure command.

CC='CL /nologo' CPP='CL /nologo /E' configure

configure defaults to using the hlc.gc grade as this is the only grade
currently supported.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOURCE INSTALLATION

In order to save time in compilation the source distribution comes with
prebuilt C files.  These C files are generated using the asm_fast grade
which is incompatible with hlc.gc.  In order to alleviate this problem:

1. Install cygwin (avoid the bug in sscanf with 1.3.1-1)

2. Install an asm_fast grade version of the compiler which uses gcc as
   the C compiler.  This can be done from a source or binary
   distribution.  Follow standard instructions.  I suggest:

   a) configure --prefix /usr/local/mercury-0.10.1
   b) make install

   Ensure your path has been modified so you can see the new mmc once it
   is built.  For example:

   a) edit /etc/profile and add /usr/local/mercury-0.10.1 to PATH

3. To build a version of the mercury compiler with MSVC++ instead of
   gcc, remotely check out a fresh version of the compiler, eg.

   a) cvs -d :pserver:guest@cvs.mercury.cs.mu.oz.au:/home/mercury1/repository login
   (password is guest)
   b) cvs -d :pserver:guest@cvs.mercury.cs.mu.oz.au:/home/mercury1/repository co -r version-0_10_1 mercury

   Then to use MSVC++ to build the compiler issue the following configure
   command.  (You must be able to run MSVC++ from command line):

   CC='CL /nologo' CPP='CL /nologo /E' configure --prefix /usr/local/msmercury
   (configure defaults to using the hlc.gc grade as this is the only
   grade currently supported).

4. make install

DO NOT USE THE SOURCE DISTRIBUTION TO BUILD THE MS-VisualC VERSION OF
THE COMPILER!!  CONFIGURE DOES NOT DETERMINE THAT THE PRE-BUILT C FILES
ARE INCOMPATIBLE IT JUST TRIES TO USE THEM ANYWAY.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLING ON NETWORK DRIVES

If you want to install on the machine, foo, in the directory \usr\local
you need to add `--prefix //foo/usr/local' as an option to configure.

Then ensure that the directory that you wish to install into is mounted
somewhere, ie

mount //foo/usr/local /temp_mount_point

and then use that mount point as the location to install into

make install INSTALL_PREFIX=/temp_mount_point

This avoids the problem that

        mkdir -p //foo/usr/local/xxx

fails.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NONE.* GRADES

Are not supported yet! But if they were and you have a file with
a large
switch in it you need to pass the following flag to mmc

--max-jump-table-size 512
