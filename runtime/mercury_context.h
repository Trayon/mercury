** mercury_context.h - defines Mercury multithreading stuff.
**
** A "context" is a Mercury thread.  (We use a different term than "thread"
** to avoid confusing Mercury threads and Posix threads.) 
** Each context is represented by a value of type MR_Context,
** which contains a detstack, a nondetstack, a trail, the various pointers
** that refer to them, a succip, and a thread-resumption continuation. 
** Contexts are initally stored in a free-list.
** When one is running, the Posix thread that is executing it has a pointer
** to its context structure `this_context'. When a context suspends, it
** calls `save_context(context_ptr)' which copies the context from the
** various registers and global variables into the structure referred to
** by `context_ptr'. The context contains no rN or fN registers - all
** registers are "context save" (by analogy to caller-save).
**
** When a new context is created information is passed to the new context
** on the stack. The top stackframe of the current context is copied to
** become the first det stackframe in the new process. (XXX this will need
** fixing eventually to include the nondet frame as well.)
**
** Contexts can migrate transparently between multiple Posix threads.
**
** Each Posix thread has its own heap and solutions heap (both allocated
** in shared memory). This makes GC harder, but enables heap allocation
** to be done without locking which is very important for performance.
** Each context has a copy of the heap pointer that is taken when it is
** switched out. If the Posix thread's heap pointer is the same as the
** copied one when the context is switched back in, then it is safe for
** the context to do heap reclamation on failure.
**
** If MR_THREAD_SAFE is not defined, then everything gets executed within a
** single Posix thread. No locking is required.

  **
  ** If hp < context_hp, then another context has truncated the heap on failure.

  ** that other context was the last one to allocate data on the heap, and we
  ** did not allocate any heap during that period of execution. That being the

  ** the current value of hp is the same as some previous value that we held,
  ** and we are now contiguous with our older data, so this algorithm will lead
  ** to holes in the heap, though GC will reclaim these.
  **

  ** were last scheduled, so we can proceed as if we had not stopped, and the
