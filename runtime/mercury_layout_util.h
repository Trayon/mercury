** A MR_Stack_Layout_Vars describes the variables that are live at a given
** program point. Some of the types of these variables may contain type
** variables. Since the values of those type variables are not known until
** runtime, the MR_Stack_Layout_Vars cannot include full typeinfos for the
** variables. Instead, it contains pseudo-typeinfos, in which some parts
** of some typeinfo structures may contain an indication "this data is
** not available at compile time, but at runtime it will be in this location".
**
** MR_materialize_typeinfos takes as input a MR_Stack_Layout_Vars
** structure. It returns a vector of typeinfos which has one entry for each
** pseudo-typeinfo in the MR_Stack_Layout_Vars structure, with this typeinfo
** being the pseudo-typeinfo with the runtime-only information substituted in.
** Since type variable numbers start at one, the element of this array at
** index zero will be unused. This means that the array will itself look
** like a typeinfo.
** 
** The vector returned by MR_materialize_typeinfos is from malloc;
** it should be freed after last use.
**
** MR_materialize_typeinfos looks up locations in the current
** environment, as indicated by the set of saved registers (including MR_sp
** and MR_curfr). MR_materialize_typeinfos_base does the same job but
** assumes the environment is given by the given values of MR_sp and MR_curfr,
** and does not assume that the registers have valid contents unless saved_regs
** is non-null.
