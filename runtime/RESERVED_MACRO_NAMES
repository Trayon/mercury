# RESERVED_MACRO_NAMES
#
# This file lists the macro names, other than the
# ones starting with `MR_', `MERCURY_', or `GC_',
# that are defined by the Mercury header files.
# The Mmakefile target `check_headers' automatically
# checks that no other macro names are defined.
# This is done to keep our headers namespace-clean,
# i.e. ensure that we don't invade the user's namespace.
#
# This file is used as the argument to `fgrep -f'.
# Lines starting with `#' will not match anything in the input,
# and can thus be used as comments.
# Other lines are treated as strings to match against.
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# This is documented in the Mercury language reference manual
# and defined by mercury_types.h.
SUCCESS_INDICATOR
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# pid_t is only defined in mercury_conf.h if it is not present
# in the system headers. I don't think there is a nice way to
# prefix this without requiring a later version of autoconf (e.g. 2.52).
pid_t
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# These are defined by mercury.h
# Normally macros should start with capital letters,
# but in this case we need to use lowercase, otherwise
# the macros wouldn't achieve their desired effect.
# The `mercury__' prefix is unique enough.

# This is defined by mps_gc/code/mercury_mps.h,
# which uses this macro for its header guard.
# Normally it would be better to use uppercase for header guard macro names,
# but that would be inconsistent with the coding style used in mps_gc/code.

# This is defined by mercury_getopt.h
# That header file is NOT #included by any of the other
# headers, so this doesn't cause any name space polution.
