** mercury_conf_param.h:
**	Defines various configuration parameters. 
**
**	Configuration parameters fall into three groups.
**	They can be set automatically by autoconf.
**	They can be passed on the command line (e.g. the mgnuc
**	script sets some options based on the grade).
**	Or their values can be implied by the settings of other parameters.
**
**	The ones defined in mercury_conf.h are determined by autoconf.
**	The remainder are documented and/or defined by this file,
**	#included by mercury_conf.h.

** Code generation options:
**
** USE_GCC_GLOBAL_REGISTERS
** USE_GCC_NONLOCAL_GOTOS
** USE_ASM_LABELS
** CONSERVATIVE_GC
** NATIVE_GC		[not yet working]
** COMPACT_ARGS
** NO_TYPE_LAYOUT
** BOXED_FLOAT
** MR_USE_TRAIL

**		--args compact
**		--no-type-layout
**		--unboxed-float
**		--use-trail
**	(respectively) in the mmc help message or the Mercury User's Guide.
**
** USE_SINGLE_PREC_FLOAT:
**	Use C's `float' rather than C's `double' for the
**	Mercury floating point type (`Float').
**
** USE_TYPE_TO_TERM:
**	Include `type_to_term' and `term_to_type' fields in type_infos.
**	[This is obsolete. USE_TYPE_LAYOUT is a better solution.]
**
** PARALLEL
**	Enable support for parallelism [not yet working].

/*
** Runtime checking options:
**
** MR_CHECK_FOR_OVERFLOW
**	(Implied by MR_LOWLEVEL_DEBUG.)
**	Check for overflow of the various memory
**	areas, e.g. heap, det stack, nondet stack,
**	before every access that might result in overflow. 
**	Causes the generated code to become bigger and less efficient.
**	Slows down compilation.
**
**	Normally MR_CHECK_FOR_OVERFLOW is not set, since
**	we trap overflows using mprotect().
*/

/*
** Debugging options:
**
** MR_STACK_TRACE
**	Require the inclusion of the layout information needed by error/1
**	and the debugger to print stack traces. This effect is achieved by
**	including MR_STACK_TRACE in the mangled grade (see mercury_grade.h).
**
** MR_REQUIRE_TRACING
**	Require that all Mercury procedures linked in should be compiled
**	with at least interface tracing.  This effect is achieved
**	by including MR_REQUIRE_TRACING in the mangled grade
**	(see mercury_grade.h).
**	Note that MR_REQUIRE_TRACING is talking about execution tracing,
**	not stack tracing; these are two independently configurable features.
**
** MR_USE_EXTERNAL_DEBUGGER:
**	Allow MR_trace() to use an external process debugger
**	(with communication done via a socket interface)
**	rather than using the debugger that is part of
**	the Mercury runtime.
**	[The external debugger has not yet been written.]
**
** MR_LOWLEVEL_DEBUG
**	Enables various low-level debugging stuff,
**	that was in the distant past used to debug
**	the low-level code generation.
**	Causes the generated code to become VERY big and VERY inefficient.
**	Slows down compilation a LOT.
**
** MR_DEBUG_GOTOS
**	(Implied by MR_LOWLEVEL_DEBUG.)
**	Enables low-level debugging of gotos.
**	Causes the generated code to become bigger and less efficient.
**	Slows down compilation.
**
** MR_DEBUG_NONDET_STACK
**	Include a "name" field in the nondet stack frames.
**	(Since this affects binary compatibility,
**	this is a "compilation model" option which affects the grade.)
**
** MR_DEBUG_AGC_SCHEDULING
**	Display debugging information while scheduling accurate garbage
**	collection.
**
** MR_DEBUG_AGC_COLLECTION
**	Display debugging information while collecting garbage using the
**	accurate garbage collector.
**
** MR_DEBUG_AGC_FORWARDING
**	Display debugging information when leaving or finding forwarding
**	pointers during accurate garbage collection.
**
** MR_DEBUG_AGC_PRINT_VARS
**	Display the values of live variables during accurate garbage
**	collection.
**
** MR_DEBUG_AGC
** 	Turn on all debugging information for accurate garbage
** 	collection.  (Equivalent to all MR_DEBUG_AGC_* macros above).
