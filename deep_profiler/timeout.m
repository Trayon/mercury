% This module implements timeouts for the deep profiler.
%
% The deep profiler uses timeouts to shut down the server process if the
% programmer has not sent it queries in a while. Before shutdown, we remove the
% named pipes that the CGI script and the server process use to communicate.
% Any later invocation of the CGI script will take the absence of the named
% pipes as indicating that there is no server process for the given data file,
% and will create a new server process, which will recreate the named pipes.
%
% Since the receipt of the alarm signal, the removal the pipes and exiting
% is not an atomic action, there is a potential race condition. However,
% there is no simple, portable way to eliminate the race condition, and the
% window of vulnerability is quite small.
%
% This module also sets up the automatic execution of the timeout action
% when the process exits, for use both when the user explicitly requests
% the shutdown of the server (which will of course happen after startup)
% and in case of program aborts (which may happen both before and after
% startup). However, immediately after startup is complete, the server
% process forks, with the parent exiting to let mdprof_cgi's wait finish,
% and the child entering a loop waiting for requests.
%
% We establish the exit action to clean up the files as soon as they are
% created, but we don't want the parent process after the fork to delete them
% while they are still in use by the child process. This is prevented by the
% boolean flag process_is_detached_server.

/*
** SIGALRM alarm signal indicates a timeout. SIGTERM usually indicates the
** machine is being shut down. The others are there to catch forceful shutdowns
** during development, both intentional ones where the programmer sends the
** signal and those caused by bugs in the server code. We would like to include
** all catchable, fatal signals in this list, but that set is somewhat OS
** dependent. The set whose existence we test for here includes all the
** signals that are at all likely to be sent to server process.
**
** We don't test for the existence of SIGALRM, because we want compilation to
** fail if it does not exist. Without alarm signals, server processes will
** never be timed out, and thus constitute a resource leak (mostly of virtual
** memory/swap space).
**
** We could avoid this problem if we had a version of atexit that executed
** its actions even when the program exits after a signal.
