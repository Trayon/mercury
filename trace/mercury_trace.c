/*
** mercury_trace.c - implements the top levels of the tracing subsystem,
** which interface to the automatically generated code in user programs.
** The trace events can be processed either by our internal debugger,
** or by an external trace-analysis style debugger. These are in
** mercury_trace_internal.c and mercury_trace_external.c respectively.
**
** After MR_trace has determined that the event needs to be processed,
** it saves all the Mercury virtual machine registers that are live at the
** call site in both the MR_fake_regs array and a separate saved_regs array.
**
** Any debugger code that wants to inspect the contents of the registers
** at the time of the call must look at the saved_regs array, which is
** passed around to all the functions that need it.
**
** Any Mercury code invoked from the debugger may update the real registers
** and the MR_fake_reg array. This includes both the general purpose registers
** and the control registers. Just before we return control to the Mercury
** program being debugged, we copy the contents of the saved_regs array back
** into the machine registers, thus overwriting the changes made by all the
** Mercury predicates we have called. There are two exceptions to this. One,
** we keep any changes to the MR_global_hp register. This is necessary to
** ensure that data structures that we want to keep permanently (e.g. help
** system nodes added by debugger commands) are not overwritten by later code.
** Two, when the debugger executes a retry command, it restores the state
** of the machine registers to a state that is appropriate for the call site.
