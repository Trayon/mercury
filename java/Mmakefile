# This Makefile sets up some symbolic links so that for the moment we can just
# include this directory (mercury/java) in our CLASSPATH to be able to compile
# some mercury files to java.
#
# The files in mercury/java/library are some hacked up versions of parts of
# the mercury library written in java. These are classes such as mercury.list,
# which require them to be in the CLASSPATH in a "mercury" directory, hence
# the first link.
# 
# The files in mercury/java/runtime are the mercury runtime classes such as
# mercury.runtime.MethodPtr. These should be in the CLASSPATH under the 
# directory "mercury/runtime", hence the second link.
