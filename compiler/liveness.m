%
% This module traverses the goal for each procedure, and adds
% liveness annotations to the goal_info for each sub-goal.
% These annotations are the pre-birth set, the post-birth set,
% the pre-death set, the post-death set, and the resume_point field.
%
% Because it recomputes each of these annotations from scratch,
% it should be safe to call this module multiple times
% (although this has not been tested yet).
%
% Note - the concept of `liveness' here is different to that used in
% mode analysis. Mode analysis is concerned with the liveness of what
% is *pointed* to by a variable, for the purpose of avoiding and/or keeping
% track of aliasing and for structure re-use optimization, whereas here
% we are concerned with the liveness of the variable itself, for the
% purposes of optimizing stack slot and register usage.
% Variables have a lifetime: each variable is born, gets used, and then dies.
% To minimize stack slot and register usage, the birth should be
% as late as possible (but before the first possible use), and the
% death should be as early as possible (but after the last possible use).
%
% We compute liveness related information in three distinct passes.
%
% The first pass, detect_liveness_in_goal, finds the first value-giving
% occurrence of each variable on each computation path. Goals containing
% the first such occurrence of a variable include that variable in their
% pre-birth set. In branched structures, branches whose endpoint is not
% reachable include a post-birth set listing the variables that should
% have been born in that branch but haven't. Variables that shouldn't have
% been born but have been (in computation paths that cannot succeed)
% are included in the post-death set of the goal concerned.
%
% The second pass, detect_deadness_in_goal, finds the last occurrence
% of each variable on each computation path. Goals containing the last
% occurrence of a variable include that variable in their post-death
% set. In branched structures, branches in which a variable is not
% used at all include a pre-death set listing the variables that
% have died in parallel branches.
%
% The third pass, detect_resume_points_in_goal, finds goals that
% establish resume points and attaches to them a resume_point
% annotation listing the variables that may be referenced by the
% code at that resume point as well as the nature of the required
% entry labels.
%
% Typeinfo liveness calculation notes:
%
% When using accurate gc or execution tracing, liveness is computed
% slightly differently.  The runtime system needs access to the
% typeinfo variables of any variable that is live at a continuation.
% 
% Hence, the invariant needed for alternate liveness calculation:
% 	a variable holding a typeinfo must be live at any continuation
% 	where any variable whose type is described (in whole or in part)
% 	by that typeinfo is live.
%
% Typeinfos are introduced as either one of the head variables, or a new
% variable created by a goal in the procedure. If introduced as a head
% variable, initial_liveness will add it to the initial live set of
% variables -- no variable could be introduced earlier than the start of
% the goal. If introduced by a goal in the procedure, that goal must
% occur before any call that requires the typeinfo, so the variable will
% be born before the continuation after the call. So the typeinfo
% variables will always be born before any continuation where they are
% needed.
% 
% A typeinfo variable becomes dead after both the following conditions
% are true: 
%
% 	(1) The typeinfo variable is not used again (when it is no
% 	    longer part of the nonlocals)
%	(2) No other nonlocal variable's type is described by that typeinfo
%	    variable.
% 
% (1) happens without any changes to the liveness computation (it is
%     the normal condition for variables becoming dead). This more
%     conservative than what is required for the invariant, but is
%     required for code generation, so we should keep it ;-)
% (2) is implemented by adding the typeinfo variables for the types of the
%     nonlocals to the nonlocals for the purposes of computing liveness.
%
% So typeinfo variables will always be born before they are needed, and
% die only when no other variable needing them will be live, so the
% invariant holds.
%
% Quantification notes:
%
% If a variable is not live on entry to a goal, but the goal gives it a value,
% the code of this module assumes that
%
% (a) any parallel goals also give it a value, or
% (b) the variable is local to this goal and hence does not occur in parallel
%     goals.
%
% If a variable occurs in the nonlocal set of the goal, the code of this
% assumes that (b) is not true, and will therefore require (a) to be true.
% If some of the parallel goals cannot succeed, the first pass will include
% the variable in their post-birth sets.
%
% If a variable occurs in the nonlocal set of the goal, but is actually
% local to the goal, then any occurrence of that variable in the postbirth
% sets of parallel goals will lead to an inconsistency, because the variable
% will not die on those parallel paths, but will die on the path that
% actually gives a value to the variable.
%
% The nonlocal set of a goal is in general allowed to overapproximate the
% true set of nonlocal variables of the goal. Since this module requires
% *exact* information about nonlocals, it must recompute the nonlocal sets
% before starting.
