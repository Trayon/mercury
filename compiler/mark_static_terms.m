% This module traverses the HLDS, updating the `how_to_construct'
% field of construction unifications.  For each construction which
% can be done statically, i.e. whose arguments are all static,
% it replaces this field with `construct_statically'.
% This field is then used by the MLDS back-end to determine when it can
% generate static initialized constants rather than using
% new_object() MLDS statements.
