Rules for implicit quantification in Mercury
--------------------------------------------

If a variable occurs in a negated context (inside a negation, inside a
universal quantification, in the condition of an if-then-else, or in a
disequality), and which does not occur outside of that negated context
other than in "parallel" goals (and in the case of a variable in the
condition of an if-then-else, other than in the "then" part of the
if-then-else), then that variable is implicitly existentially
quantified inside the negation.

"Parallel" goals are defined as follows:  different branches of a
disjunction are parallel; and the "else" part of an if-then-else is
parallel to the condition and the "then" part (and vice versa).
