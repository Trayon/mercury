<h1> TODO LIST </h1>

<hr>
<!-------------------------->

<p>


For more information on any of these issues, contact mercury@cs.mu.oz.au.

<p>

<h2> syntax </h2>

<p>

<ul>
<li> Warn about the use of the deprecated old-style lambda expressions.

</ul>

<h2> type system </h2>

<p>

<ul>
<li> Fix the three known type inference bugs (see comments in typecheck.m).

</ul>

<h2> mode analysis </h2>

<p>

<ul>
<li> fix various bugs in mode inference:
     need to fix it to work properly in the presence of functions;
     also need to change normalise_inst so that it handles complicated
     insts such as `list_skel(any)'.

<li> extend the mode system to allow known aliasing.
     This is needed to make partially instantiated modes and unique modes work.
	[being done by bromage, nearly finished]

<li> report an error if two mode declarations for a predicate
     specify identical modes.

<li> detect incorrect usage of `bound(...)' insts.
     That is, make sure that all of the functors in a bound(...) inst
     are valid functors for the type.

</ul>

<h2> determinism analysis </h2>

<h2> unique modes </h2>

<ul>
<li> handle nested unique modes

<li> we will probably need to extend unique modes a bit,
     in as-yet-unknown ways; need more experience here

</ul>

<h2> module system </h2>

<ul>
<li> check that the interface for a module is type-correct
  independently of any declarations or imports in the implementation
  section

<li> there are some problems with nested modules (see the language
  reference manual)

</ul>

<h2> C interface </h2>

<ul>
<li> exporting things for manipulating Mercury types from C

<li> better support for types defined in C

<li> need to deal with memory management issues

</ul>

<h2> code generation </h2>

<ul>
<li> take advantage of unique modes to do compile-time garbage collection
  and structure reuse.

</ul>

<hr>
<!-------------------------->


<h1> WISH LIST </h1>

<h2> type-system </h2>

<ul>
<li> allow explicit type qualifications `X : Type'
	[already done, but need to change module qualifier op to `.' first]

<li> allow std_util:construct/4 to work for existential types

<li> remove limitation that higher-order terms are monomorphic.
     i.e. allow universal quantifiers at the top level of
     higher-order types, e.g. <samp>:- pred foo(all [T] pred(T)).</samp>.

<li> constructor classes

<li> allow a module exporting an abstract type to specify that other modules
     should not be allowed to test two values of that type for equality (similar
     to Ada's limited private types). This would be useful for e.g. sets
     represented as unordered lists with possible duplicates.
  	[this is a subset of the functionality of type classes]

<li> subtypes?

<li> optimisation of type representation and manipulation (possibly
     profiler guided) 

<li> fold/unfolding of types
</ul>

<h2> mode analysis </h2>

<ul>
<li> split construct/deconstruct unifications into their atomic
     "micro-unification" pieces when necessary.
     (When is it necessary?)

<li> handle polymorphic modes (some research issues?)

<li> handle abstract insts in the same way abstract types are handled
     (a research issue - is this possible at all?)

<li> implement `willbe(Inst)' insts, for parallelism

<li> mode segments & high-level transformation of circularly moded programs.
</ul>

<h2> determinism analysis: </h2>

<ul>
<li> propagate information about bindings from the condition of an if-then-else
     to the else so that
<pre>
	(if X = [] then .... else X = [A|As], ...)
</pre>
     is considered det.

<li> turn chains of if-then-elses into switchs where possible.
	[done by fjh, but not committed; zs not convinced that
	this is a good idea]

</ul>

<h2> higher-order preds: </h2>

<ul>
<li> implement single-use higher-order predicate modes.
     Single-use higher-order predicates would be allowed to bind curried
     arguments, and to have unique modes for curried arguments.
 
<li> allow taking the address of a predicate with multiple modes

<li> improve support for higher-order programming, eg. by providing
     operators in the standard library which do things like:
     <ul>
     <li>compose functions
     <li>take a predicate with one output argument and treat it like a function.
     ie. <tt>:- func (pred(T)) = T.</tt>
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2> module system: </h2>

<ul>
<li> produce warnings for implementation imports that are not needed

<li> produce warnings for imports that are in the wrong place
  (in the interface instead of the implementation, and vice versa)
  	[vice versa done by stayl]
</ul>

<h2> code generation: </h2>

<ul>
<li> use floating point registers

<li> allow floating point fields of structures without boxing
	(need multi-word fields)

<li> inter-procedural register allocation 

<li> stack allocation of structures

<li> retarget code generator to Java VM
</ul>

<h2> source-level transformations </h2>

<ul>
<li> more work on module system, separate compilation, and the multiple
     specialisation problem

<li> extended DCGs

<li> transform non-tail-recursive predicates into tail-recursive form
     using accumulators
	[being worked on by petdr]

<li> improvements to deforestation / partial deduction

</ul>

<h2> low-level optimizations </h2>

<ul>
<li> reduce the overhead of higher-order predicate calls (avoid copying
     the real registers into the fake_reg array and back)

<li> tail recursion optimization using pass-by-reference argument conventions
	[being worked on by dmo]

<li> other specializations, e.g. if argument is known to be bound to
     f(X,Y), then just pass X and Y in registers

<li> trim stack frames before making recursive calls, to minimize stack usage
     (this would probably be a pessimization much of the time - zs)
     and to minimize unnecessary garbage retention.
</ul>

  
<h2> compilation speed </h2>

<ul>
<li> improve efficiency of the expansion of equivalence types (currently O(N^2))
     (e.g. this is particularly bad when compiling live_vars.m).

<li> improve efficiency of the module import handling (currently O(N^2))

<li> improve the efficiency of mode checking very large facts
     (e.g. this is particularly bad when compiling eliza.m).

</ul>


<h2> better diagnostics </h2>

<ul>
<li> optional warning for any implicit quantifiers whose scope is not
     the entire clause (the "John Lloyd" option :-).

<li> give a better error message for the use of if-then without else.

<li> give a better error message for the use of `<=' instead of `=<'
     (but how?)

<li> give a better error message for type errors involving higher-order pred
     constants (requested by Bart Demoen)

<li> give better error messages for syntax errors in lambda expressions
</ul>

<h2> general </h2>

<ul>
<li> coroutining and parallel versions of Mercury

<li> implement streams (need coroutining at least)

<li> implement a very fast turn-around bytecode compiler/interpreter/debugger,
     similar to Gofer
     [not-so-fast bytecode compiler done, but bytecode interpreter
     not implemented]

<li> implement "accurate" garbage collection

<li> implement parallel garbage collection

<li> implement user-defined operators: <br>
	Add a new construct `:- op(Pred, Type, Op).' as in Prolog;
	change prog_io.m to parse this construct and call io__op
	accordingly.  But how does this fit in with the module system?

<li> support for easier formal specification translation (eg a Z library,
     or Z to Mercury).

<li> improve support for constraint programming

<li> implement a source visualisation tool

<li> distributed Mercury

<li> improved development environment

<li> additional software engineering tools
	<ul>
  	<li> coverage analysis
	<li> automatic testing
	</ul>

<li> literate Mercury

<li> implement a GUI library (eg Hugs - Fudgets)

<li> profiling guided optimisations
	<ul>
	<li> use profiling information to direct linker for optimal
	     code placement (Alpha has a tool for this).
	</ul>

<li> use of attribute grammar technology
	(including visit sequence optimization)
	to implement code with circular modes
</ul>
