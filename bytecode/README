This directory holds the source code for the Mercury bytecode
utilities. `mdis' is the Mercury bytecode disassembler.
`mbi' is the Mercury bytecode interpreter.
`libmbi' is the same thing, minus main().

All exported symbols defined in modules in this directory should be prefixed
with `MB_', for "Mercury Bytecode", to avoid clashes with names defined in
other packages.
